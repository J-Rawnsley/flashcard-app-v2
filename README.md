# Flashcard App

## Description

This app is designed for English language learners. It helps the user create "flashcards" - little pieces of paper with a word on one side and a hint on the other. Creating flashcards and reviewing them on a regular basis is one of the best ways to improve vocabulary and spelling. These days, many learners use digital flashcard software such as Anki, Quizlet and Brainscape. These apps help you create, organise and review your flashcards, but they don't give you any help with the content of the flashcards. My flashcard app intends to fill that gap.

If you are learning a second language, Your flashcard content will be a word you want to learn and a hint or question. it is possible to use words in your first (native) language as hints for words in your target langauge. But research shows that this is less effective because it breaks immersion in the target language. It is better to use hints in the target language, which should be grammatically correct sentences that allow the learner to guess the missing word while beig immersed in the target language and seeing how it is used in a sentence.

This app allows learners to quickly make these kinds of target-language-only flashcards (as long as their target language is English) by inputting a word (or many words at once) and instantly getting a hint for each word. 

I created this app to fill a genuine need that I have in my job as an English (as a second language) teacher. I found that my learners were very keen to use flashcards to help improve their vocabulary, but not very good at creating them. I wanted to help them learn words more effiecintly. 

I have been somewhat successful in achieving my aims for the flashcard app, with the main limitation being that the quality of data coming from the API is not always as good as I would have liked. The app searches the fetched data for any example sentences for the requested word or words. But a lot of words don't have example sentences, and for those that do have examples, the examples are not always relevant to the most common usage of the word, which could be confusing for some learners. With that said, it is still a tool that could be useful for an English learner who can use it intelligently, and as far as I know is the only web app of this kind available.
